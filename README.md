# Designing-a-voice-signal-recorder-and-use-of-filtering-by-using-MATLAB

Condition's that must be satisfied:

Step I: Record my own voice with MATLAB function ‘audiorecorder’ for 12 seconds with a sampling
frequency of 44 KHz.

Step II: Display the voice signal in time domain with proper scaling and include it the report.

Step III: Apply ideal filter design techniques (IIR) to build a LPF filter with cutoff frequency 3.7 KHz.
Magnitude spectrum will be consisted of 1 and 0 values for pass-band and stop-band frequencycoefficients respectively.

Step IV: Reconstruct the audio file again and listen to voice after this signal processing.
